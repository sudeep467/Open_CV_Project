What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features.

OpenCV installation on WINDOWS
To install OpenCV, just go to the command-line and type the following command:

pip install opencv-python
How Does A Computer Read An Image?


We are humans we can easily make it out that is the image of a person who is me. But if we ask computer “is it my photo?”. The computer can’t say anything because the computer is not figuring out it all on its own. The computer reads any image as a range of values between 0 and 255. For any color image, there are 3 primary channels -red, green and blue.

Applications of OpenCV:
There are lots of applications which are solved using OpenCV, some of them are listed below

face recognition
Automated inspection and surveillance
Number of people – count (foot traffic in a mall, etc)
Vehicle counting on highways along with their speeds
Interactive art installations
Anamoly (defect) detection in the manufacturing process (the odd defective products)
Street view image stitching
Video/image search and retrieval
Robot and driver-less car navigation and control
object recognition
Medical image analysis
Movies – 3D structure from motion
TV Channels advertisement recognition
